# flow radar

flow: router -> collector

xor

initial iblt?

switch encode flows, constant time, report to collector,

collector decode.

handling hash collisions? handle them!

using xor to save different flows, less memory!

new flow? update flow filter(only once)

not new? dont xor, dont plus flow count

flow filter cound return false true ==> become worse as time goes

single decode: find pure cell(flow cnt === 1), remove it, loop till no pure cell exists.

network-wide decode: flow overlap across hops, different hash functions across hops to create more pure cells

zigzag decode? neighbors help each other.

what if packet lost? calculate cnts for each switch, solve linear functions.

single decode: error rate similar to bloom filter

fat tree: use merchant switches to construct data center

ECMP: load balance, what if one link failed?

memory usage: similar to perfect hash

bandwidth usage: low

net decode: more flows, more time

counter decode: majority of time
