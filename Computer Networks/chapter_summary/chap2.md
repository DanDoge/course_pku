### physical layer

notes from book *computer networks*

bandwith?
- width of frequency range w/o being strongly attenuated
    - usually, when received power has fallen by half, 3dB

twisting pair?
- why twisting? cause two parallel wires constitute a fine antenna
- signal as diff. in voltage between two wires

full duplex / half duplex

communicate over electrical wiring?
- data signal-> high frequency, power-> low frequency

optical fiber
- bottleneck: converting bet. electrical and optical signal

chromatic dispersion: light pulses spread out as propagate

ultraviolet light, X-ray, gamma ray: high frequency
- but hard to modulate, ot propagate through buildings

frequency hopping: frequency hops hundreds time a sec.

delayed wave may cancel direct wave: multipath fading

water absorbs short microwaves well

satellites: inherently broadcast media

TODO: 2.5
