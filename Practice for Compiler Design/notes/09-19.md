### Lex and Yacc

lex for lexical analyzer, while yacc for syntax
- lex: find a regex, excute some operation or return some token
    - three parts, devided by "%%"
    - first and last being pure C code
    - second being some rules
    - e.g. variable name in C \_+(char)+[0-9]\*(char)\*[0-9]\*
    - .l =lex=> .c =gcc=> exe file
    - by convention: first part is global declaration, third being additional C functions
    - below shows a simple lex porgram
    - yywrap, return 1 if no more file need to be parsed
    - if multiple regex hits, choose the longest one
    - get yylval, return TOKEN <== in lex

```text
%%
.|\n  ECHO; // same as printf("%s\n", yytext);
%%
```

- yacc
    - def TOKEN, process yylval
