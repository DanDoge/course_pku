lowbit(x) = x & (-x)

c[i] = sum(a[i - lowbit(i) + 1], ..., a[i])
- s.t. sum(a[0], ..., a[i]) = sum(c[n_1], ..., c[n_m])
    - where n_{i - 1} = n_{i} - lowbit(n_{i})
- construct in O(n) time
    - get sum(i) in O(n) time first
    - after c[i] constructed, sum[i] is obsolete
        - esp. after a[i] changed!
- sum(k) has at most log(k) terms
    - by subtracting lowbit(k), # of 1 in binary repersentation of n decreases by 1
- sum(a[i], ..., a[j]) also get in O(logN) time
- update a[i]
    - update *only* c[n_1], c[n_2 = n_1 + lowbit(i)], ..., c[n_m]
- not only sum, but max. min.
    - only apply to max(a[0], ..., a[i]) this time, not max(a[i], ..., a[j])
    - if f[i, j] = g(f[1, i], f[1, j]) in O(1) time, vanilla c[i] would work
