### numerical intergration

Monte Carlo method
- convergrnce rate irrelavant to dimention, 1 / sqrt(n)
    - avoid curse of dimensionality
- I_n -p-> I

exact simulation
- inverse cdf
    - proof of x ~ p? p(x in [a, b]) = F[b] - F[a]
    - Box-Muller transformation
        - uniform sample theta, r according to 2d Gaussian
        - similar to intergrat Gaussian dist.
